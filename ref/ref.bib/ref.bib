	abstract = {A highlighted issue relating to the financial distress of public companies raises more debate from both academic and current practice perspectives as financial markets are currently a key source of growth for the local and international economies. In the context of advanced technology and the digital revolution, forecasting and early detection of financial distress are important methods that contribute to increasing confidence between investors and the market and help to make sound decisions promptly to avoid reaching bankruptcy (Fuentes et al., 2023). This study employs machine learning algorithms to measure the probability of financial distress of listed firms on the Vietnam Stock Exchange by using a dataset with 4,936 observations from 2009 to 2020. The research has identified internal determinants such as debt-to-equity ratio, asset turnover ratio, and profit margin ratio as indicators that have the greatest impact on financial distress under different models. The results reveal that Model 1 — Altman and Model 3 — Zmijewski predict financial distress with an accuracy rate of 98\%. In addition, we have determined the threshold when using the decision tree algorithm, which has an important impact on the financial distress of listed firms. This finding contributes to the existing literature review and is consistent with previous studies of Chen et al. (2021) and Martono and Ohwada (2023).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to compare the prediction accuracy of traditional distress prediction models for the firms which are at an early and advanced stage of distress in an emerging market, Pakistan, during 2001–2015. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology involves constructing model scores for financially distressed and stable firms and then comparing the prediction accuracy of the models with the original position. In addition to the testing for the whole sample period, comparison of the accuracy of the distress prediction models before, during, and after the financial crisis was also done. Findings: The results indicate that the three-variable probit model has the highest overall prediction accuracy for our sample, while the Z-score model more accurately predicts insolvency for both types of firms, i.e., those that are at an early stage as well as those that are at an advanced stage of financial distress. Furthermore, the study concludes that the predictive ability of all the traditional financial distress prediction models declines during the period of the financial crisis. Originality/value: An important contribution is the widening of the definition of financially distressed firms to consider the early warning signs related to failure in dividend/bonus declaration, quotation of face value, annual general meeting, and listing fee. Further, the results suggest that there is a need to develop a model by identifying variables which will have a higher impact on the financial distress of firms operating in both developed and developing markets.},

	abstract = {Financial distress is when a company faces significant difficulties meeting its financial obligations and maintaining profitability, leading to bankruptcy, insolvency, and severe economic losses. Therefore, early warning for companies at risk of financial distress is vital for business stakeholders to take timely corrective actions and avoid adverse outcomes. Existing financial distress predictions often rely on historical datasets, incorporating various indicators collected through varied methodologies and experts’ opinions. The challenge arises in discerning which indicators are pivotal for predicting corporate distress, as their influence and relevance may vary. This study proposed a machine learning framework to eliminate variations of different experts’ knowledge when selecting pivotal indicators. Data containing 4006 companies and 204 indicators was extracted from CSMAR. The Chi-square test is employed to select significant indicators. The correlation of these selected indicators is modeled using the C4.5 decision tree. Results showed that this selected feature set is closely aligned with those obtained when utilizing all features in the data. A thorough comparison of the indicators selected by the expert revealed notable distinctions. Features chosen by the Chi-square test are related to financial ratios and also exhibit a pronounced focus on societal attention, shareholding concentration, and market dynamics.},

Recent evidence suggests that machine learning models have produced superior results to traditional statistical models and have become the driving force for dramatic improvement in the financial industry. However, a much-debated question is whether the prediction results from black box machine learning models can be interpreted. In this study, we compared the predictive power of machine learning algorithms and applied SHAP values to interpret the prediction results on the dataset of listed companies in Vietnam from 2010 to 2021. The results showed that the extreme gradient boosting and random forest models outperformed other models. In addition, based on Shapley values, we also found that long-term debts to equity, enterprise value to revenues, account payable to equity, and diluted EPS had greatly influenced the outputs. In terms of practical contributions, the study helps credit rating companies have a new method for predicting the possibility of default of bond issuers in the market. The study also provides an early warning tool for policymakers about the risks of public companies in order to develop measures to protect retail investors against the risk of bond default.},

	abstract = {Financial distress is generally considered the most severe consequence for firms with poor financial performance. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global business system and exacerbated the number of financially distressed firms in many countries. Only firms with strong financial fundamentals can survive extreme events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Vietnam is no exception. However, studies examining financial distress using accounting-based indicators, particularly at the industry level, have largely been ignored in the Vietnamese context, particularly with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, comprehensively examines financial distress for 500 Vietnamese listed firms during the 2012–2021 period. Our study uses interest coverage and times-interest-earned ratios to proxy a firm’s financial distress. First, our findings confirm the validity of Altman’s Z”- score model in Vietnam only when the interest coverage ratio is used as a proxy for financial distress. Second, our empirical findings indicate that only four financial ratios, including
              EBIT/Total Assets
              ,
              Net Income/Total Assets
              ,

              , and
              Total Equity/Total Liabilities
              , can be used in predicting financial distress in Vietnam. Third, our analysis at the industry level indicates that the "Construction \& Real Estates" industry, a significant contributor to the national economy, exhibits the most significant risk exposure, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Policy implications have emerged based on the findings from this study.},

              This paper assesses the classification performance of the
              Z‐
              Score model in predicting bankruptcy and other types of firm distress, with the goal of examining the model's usefulness for all parties, especially banks that operate internationally and need to assess the failure risk of firms. We analyze the performance of the
              Z‐
              Score model for firms from 31 European and three non‐European countries using different modifications of the original model. This study is the first to offer such a comprehensive international analysis. Except for the United States and China, the firms in the sample are primarily private, and include non‐financial companies across all industrial sectors. We use the original
              Z
              ′′‐Score model developed by Altman,
              Corporate Financial Distress: A Complete Guide to Predicting, Avoiding, and Dealing with Bankruptcy
              (1983) for private and public manufacturing and non‐manufacturing firms. While there is some evidence that
              Z‐
              Score models of bankruptcy prediction have been outperformed by competing market‐based or hazard models, in other studies,
              Z‐
              Score models perform very well. Without a comprehensive international comparison, however, the results of competing models are difficult to generalize. This study offers evidence that the general
              Z‐
              Score model works reasonably well for most countries (the prediction accuracy is approximately 0.75) and classification accuracy can be improved further (above 0.90) by using country‐specific estimation that incorporates additional variables.},

	abstract = {For the most part, research purporting to address the issue of financial distress has actually studied samples of bankrupt companies. Financial distress and bankruptcy are different. In contrast, this paper starts with a sample of companies that are financially distressed but not yet bankrupt. The sample was obtained by screening the Compustat industry database with a three-tiered identification system. The screen bifurcated companies into financially and non-financially distressed groups. A multi-tiered screen reduces the incidence of mistakenly identifying a non-distressed company as financially distressed. The paper then compares factors indicating the likelihood of future bankruptcies to those indicating future financial distress. To do this, an early warning financial-distress model was developed and compared to a methodologically similar existent model of bankruptcy. The final financial distress model included only one variable present in the bankruptcy model and four new variables. The limited overlap of explanatory factors between the models questions the similarity of financial distress and bankruptcy. Statistical tests lend support to the notion that the bankruptcy process is not just a continuation of a downward spiraling cycle of financial distress. Our hypothesis is that financial distress is something that happens to companies as a consequence of operating decisions or external forces while bankruptcy is something that companies choose to do to protect their assets from creditors.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to tackle the problem of low accuracy in predicting financial distress in Chinese industrial enterprises, attributable to data imbalance and insufficient information. It utilizes annual data on systemic risk indicators and financial metrics of Chinese industrial enterprises listed on the China’s A-share market between 2008 and 2022 to construct the adaptive weighted XGBoost-Bagging model for corporate financial distress prediction. Empirical findings demonstrate that systemic risk indicators possess predictive potential independent of traditional financial information, rendering them valuable non-financial early warning indicators for China’s industrial sector; moreover, they help to enhance the predictive accuracy of various comparative models. The adaptive weighted XGBoost-Bagging model incorporating systemic risk indicators effectively addresses challenges arising from data imbalance and information scarcity, significantly improving the accuracy of financial distress prediction in Chinese industrial enterprises under the 2015 Chinese stock market crash, the Sino-US trade friction, and the COVID-19 epidemic; as such, it can be used as an efficient risk early warning tool for China’s industrial sector.},
